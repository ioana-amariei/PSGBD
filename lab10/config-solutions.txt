ORA-24247: network access denied by access control list (ACL)
This error message means that no access control list has been assigned to the host you (your application) are trying to access, or no required privileges have been granted to the user by adding user to the ACL.

Solution :

Step 1:

    SQL> grant execute on utl_http to scott;

    Grant succeeded. 

Step 2:  Conn as sysdba

BEGIN
DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.CREATE_ACL (
acl => 'studentdev.xml',
description => 'Permissions to access  mail',
principal => 'STUDENT',
is_grant => TRUE,
privilege => 'connect',
start_date => SYSTIMESTAMP,
end_date => NULL);
COMMIT;
END;
/

Step 3:

begin
DBMS_NETWORK_acl_ADMIN.ADD_PRIVILEGE(
acl => 'studentdev.xml',
principal => 'STUDENT',
is_grant => true,
privilege => 'resolve'
);
COMMIT;
END;
/

Step 4:

BEGIN
DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.ASSIGN_ACL (
acl => 'studentdev.xml',
host => '*');
COMMIT;
END;
/

Step 5:

select acl , host , lower_port , upper_port from DBA_NETWORK_ACLS;
select acl , principal , privilege , is_grant from DBA_NETWORK_ACL_PRIVILEGES; 

Step 6: Send mail as scott user

begin
send_mail('test','ioana.c.birsan@gmail.com');
end; 
/


    
Drop ACL :

BEGIN
DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.drop_acl (
acl => ‘studentdev.xml”);
COMMIT;
END;
